                     operating characteristic</a> (ROC) plots of two diagnostic tests (ratio of the AUC of the first test to the AUC of the second test: blue plot, ratio of the AOC of the first test to the AOC of the second test: orange plot).

                     title="glossary:  measurement uncertainty">uncertainty of measurement</a> of the tests. A normal distribution of the uncertainty is assumed. The uncertainty of the first test is defined. It is assumed that the uncertainty of the second test is greater than the uncertainty of the first test and varies up to a user defined upper bound. The six parameters that you can vary using the sliders are measured in arbitrary units.
                  </p>
				  <h4>Comment</h4>
				  <p class="c1">
					The area under a ROC curve is used as an index of the diagnostic accuracy of the respective test. The relative change of the area over the curve against the uncertainty of measurement is greater than the absolute value of the relative change of the area under the curves. Therefore, although the uncertainty of measurement has little effect on the diagnostic accuracy of the test, it has a considerably greater effect on its diagnostic inaccuracy.	
				 </p>
				 <p class="c1">
					To the best of my knowledge, measures of the area over the ROC curve against the uncertainty of measurement have not been discussed in the literature.

					The Wilson score method with continuity correction is used for calculating the confidence intervals of the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value. For the calculation of the confidence intervals of the (diagnostic) odds ratio, the likelihood ratio for a positive test result and the likelihood ratio for a negative test result, it is assumed that their natural logarithms have asymptotically normal distributions.

				  <h4>Comment</h4>
				  <p class="c1">
					The area under a ROC curve is used as an index of the diagnostic accuracy of the respective test. Assuming <span class="c7"><em>AUC</em></span>(<span class="c7"><em>u</em></span>) is the area under an ROC curve and <span class="c7"><em>AOC</em></span>(<span class="c7"><em>u</em></span>) is the area over the ROC curve for an uncertainty of measurement u, we have <span class="c7"><em>AOC</em></span>(<span class="c7"><em>u</em></span>) = 1 - <span class="c7"><em>AUC</em></span>(<span class="c7"><em>u</em></span>). Therefore, it can be considered that the area over the ROC curve is an index of diagnostic inaccuracy. In fact, as the plots of this Demonstration show, the relative change, the rate of change, and the relative rate of change of the area over a ROC curve against the uncertainty of measurement are greater than the respective measures of the area under the ROC curve, for the same populations.

                     title="glossary: uncertainty">uncertainty</a>. The objective for this work is to develop a tool for calculating the uncertainty of diagnostic accuracy measures, as diagnostic accuracy is fundamental to clinical decision-making. 
				  Results: For this reason, a freely available interactive program has been developed in Wolfram Language. The program provides six modules with nine submodules, for calculating and plotting the standard and expanded uncertainty and the resultant confidence intervals of various diagnostic accuracy measures of screening or diagnostic tests, which measure a normally distributed measurand, applied at a single point in time in non-diseased and diseased populations. This is done for differing population sample sizes, mean and standard deviation of the measurand, diagnostic threshold and standard measurement uncertainty of the test.
				  The application of the program is illustrated with a case study of glucose measurements in diabetic and non-diabetic populations, that demonstrates the calculation of the uncertainty of diagnostic accuracy measures.
				  Conclusion: The presented interactive program is user-friendly and can be used as a flexible educational and research tool in medical decision making, to calculate and explore the uncertainty of diagnostic accuracy measures.
