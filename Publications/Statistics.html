                  <h4>Abstract</h4>
                  <p class="c1">
                     In clinical chemistry, it is assumed that the probability
                     distribution of the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Analytical_Error" title=
                        "glossary: amnalytical error">analytical error</a> is normal. This assumption
                     of the normality of the analytical error is implied by the successful
                     application of the linearization to the analytical systems. Accordingly, the
                     analytical error may be represented as the sum of many small contributions none
                     of which contributes very much to the total error. Deviations from normality
                     have been documented, as a number of studies shows that the probability of very
                     large errors (e.g. &gt;7 standard deviations) is much greater than expected
                     (Clin Chem 1997;43:1352-6). Therefore, it is possible that there are nonlinear
                     components of the analytical error of some analytical systems, contributing
                     substantially to the total error. Actually, it has been empirically found that
                     the behavior of nonlinear <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Complex_Systems" title=
                        "glossary: complex systems">complex systems</a> is often exponential rather
                     than Gaussian and their exponential <a href=
                        "../Glossary/index.html#Probability_Density_Function">probability density function</a>
                     (pdf) has been described (Science 1999;284:87-9). Large errors are much more
                     probable with the exponential pdf than with the Gaussian. Consequently, we may
                     assume that the error of some analytical systems may be approximated by the sum
                     of a linear component of error with Gaussian pdf and a nonlinear component with
                     exponential pdf. The pdf of the total error of these analytical systems should
                     be the convolution integral of the Gaussian pdf with standard deviation
                     <span class="c7">s</span>, and the exponential pdf of the absolute value of the
                     nonlinear component of the error, with parameter <span class="c7">l s</span>,
                     where <span class="c7">l</span> is a weighting factor. It is remarkable that
                     simulated series of measurements with the proposed pdf meet the criteria for
                     normality in many cases. For example, among 10,000 series of 100 measurements,
                     with the proposed pdf and a weighting factor of 0.5, only 5.2% of them rejected
                     the hypothesis of normality, based on the measures of skewness and kurtosis on
                     the significance level of 0.01. Among 10,000 series of 1,000 such measurements
                     17.4% of them rejected the same hypothesis. On the other hand, the
                     probabilities that the error of those measurements exceed 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7
                     standard deviations are approximately 1.04, 1.7, 6.5, 62, 1551, and 103,232
                     times greater than the respective probabilities of the Gaussian pdf. Assuming
                     the proposed pdf and using <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Numerical_Methods" title=
                        "glossary: numerical methods">numerical methods</a>, I have estimated the
                     critical errors as functions of the random and systematic errors, plotted their
                     graphs, and estimated the power function graphs of various <a href=
                        "../Glossary/index.html#Quality_Control" title="glossary: quality control">quality
                     control</a> (QC) rules, for different values of <span class="c7">l</span>. The
                     critical errors can be significantly less than the respective ones of the
                     Gaussian distribution, while the probabilities for false rejection are greater
                     than the respective probabilities of the Gaussian distribution. In conclusion,
                     to optimize the QC planning process, we should explore the possibility that
                     there exists a nonlinear component of error, particularly when QC is applied
                     upon new ultra sensitive assays and complex analytical systems. Either the
                     proposed pdf could be used or alternative ones that would approximate the
                     empirically found distributions of the analytical error.

                     In clinical chemistry, a number of studies shows that the
                     probability of very large errors is much greater than expected from the
                     Gaussian distribution. In addition, it has been empirically found that the

                     systems</a> is often asymptotically exponential. Consequently, we may assume
                     that the error of some analytical systems may be approximated by the sum of a
                     linear component of error with Gaussian distribution and a nonlinear component
                     with Laplacian. Then, the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Probability_Density_Function"

                     probable with the proposed distribution than with the Gaussian. Simulated
                     series of measurements with the proposed distribution often meet the criteria
                     for normality. The critical errors and the probabilities for critical error
                     detection are less than the respective ones of the Gaussian distribution. The
                     probabilities for false rejection are greater. To optimize the quality control
